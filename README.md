## Note
In this project I have demonstrated data fetch for the first page to get `Car of the week ` using Redux-thunk in more traditional way. The `/action/carActions.js ` is responsible for running the graphql query.
For the rest of the project however, I am using more recent aproach using [Apollo-client!](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client) :rocket: . 

# Run the project
Assuming you are running Node v6  
```
cd client && npm i && npm start 
cd server && npm i && npm start 
```

## Run in docker 


# Development process
The steps that were involved to build up this demo project
1. Creating graphql sever
2. Create-react-app 
3. Add redux-thunk to client
4. Add Apollo to the project
5. Load data rom Apollo client
